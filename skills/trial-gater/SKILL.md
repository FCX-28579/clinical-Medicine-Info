description: Use when evaluating one or more clinical trials' eligibility against a specific patient profile, criterion-by-criterion. Triggers when the parent clinical-trial-matching skill needs gating verdicts (match / conditional / exclude) with R1-R5 hard rules applied. Replaces v1.7.x scoring/gating.py + regex-based rule engine.

# trial-gater

You are evaluating whether a specific patient is eligible for a specific clinical trial. You read the trial's parsed inclusion/exclusion criteria and the patient profile, then output a structured verdict.

## Why this is an LLM subskill, not Python regex

v1.7.x used `scoring/gating.py` with regex matching. It silently failed on:

- Patients with prior anti-PD-1 (camrelizumab) facing trials that exclude "prior immune checkpoint inhibitor" — regex looked for "PD-1" string, missed it
- Patients with prior anti-VEGF (bevacizumab + apatinib) facing trials that exclude "prior VEGF-targeted therapy" — same failure mode
- Pan-RAS trials matched by "RAS mutation (any)" rule, then incorrectly tagged with G12D drug class baselines for G12C patients
- Trials with eligibility text in non-canonical phrasings ("must not have received any KRAS-directed therapy" — not caught by `prior_kras_inhibitor_excluded` boolean)

Clinical eligibility is judgment, not pattern matching. This subskill makes that judgment explicit.

## Inputs

```json
{
  "trials": [
    {
      "id": "NCT...",
      "title": "...",
      "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"],
      "sponsor": "...",
      "interventions": ["sotorasib", "cetuximab"],
      "parsed_criteria": {
        "inclusion": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2", ...],
        "exclusion": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2", ...],
        "raw": "..."
      },
      "china_sites": [...]
    }
  ],
  "patient": { /* see clinical-trial-matching SKILL.md Step 1 schema */ }
}
```

## Output

For each trial, emit a JSON object per `rules/output-gating-verdict-schema.md`. Aggregate as:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "trial_id": "NCT...", ...verdict... },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Process (per trial)

```
1. Read trial.parsed_criteria.inclusion, evaluate each criterion against patient:
   → ✅ 符合 / ❌ 不符合 / ⚠️ 边界 / ❓ 信息缺失

2. Read trial.parsed_criteria.exclusion, evaluate each:
   → ✅ 无冲突 / ❌ 触发排除 / ⚠️ 可能冲突 / ❓ 信息缺失

3. Apply hard rules R1–R5 (see rules/R*-*.md). Any trigger demotes match → conditional
   (or, for R2-hard, demotes to exclude).

4. Initial verdict:
   - match: all inclusion ✅, all exclusion ✅, no R1-R5 trigger
   - conditional: any inclusion ⚠️/❓ OR any exclusion ⚠️/❓ OR any R1-R5 trigger
   - exclude: any inclusion ❌ OR any exclusion ❌ (hard exclusion)

5. Output the per-criterion table + verdict + rationale.
```

## Hard rules (must apply)

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| [R1](rules/R1-prior-same-class-drug.md) | Trial excludes prior same-class drug AND patient has received that class | Demote `match` → `conditional` |
| [R2](rules/R2-treatment-line-mismatch.md) | Trial line policy < patient lines completed | Demote (1L hard limit → `exclude`; otherwise → `conditional`) |
| [R3](rules/R3-indication-scope.md) | Trial's primary expansion indication is not patient's cancer type | Demote `match` → `conditional` |
| [R4](rules/R4-organ-function-borderline.md) | Patient organ function within ±10% of trial threshold | Demote `match` → `conditional` |
| [R5](rules/R5-missing-critical-fields.md) | ≥2 ❓ on critical inclusion criteria | Demote `match` → `conditional`; list fields to obtain |

## Output schema

See [`rules/output-gating-verdict-schema.md`](rules/output-gating-verdict-schema.md) for the full JSON contract.

## Calling convention

This subskill is invoked by the parent `clinical-trial-matching` skill via Agent dispatch:

```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
      description="trial-gater batch (5 trials)",
      prompt="Use the trial-gater skill (skills/trial-gater/SKILL.md).
              Evaluate the following 5 trials against the patient.
              Trials JSON: <inline> | Patient JSON: <inline>
              Output verdict JSON per rules/output-gating-verdict-schema.md.")
```

For interactive testing: invoke directly with `Skill(skill="trial-gater", args="...")`.
