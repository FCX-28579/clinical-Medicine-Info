# Risk profile: Bispecific antibody in MSS CRC

MSS (microsatellite stable) CRC is the immune-cold majority of metastatic CRC and historically responds poorly to single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Bispecifics — particularly T-cell engagers — are a emerging strategy.

## Drugs / classes in this space

- **Anti-PD-1 × anti-VEGF bispecific**: ivonescimab (AK112) — has data in NSCLC, expanding to CRC
- **Anti-CTLA-4 × anti-PD-1 bispecific**: tarlatamab-style architectures
- **CEA × CD3 BiTE**: cibisatamab (RG7802) — exploratory in mCRC
- **DLL3 × CD3**: not CRC-relevant
- **TIGIT bispecifics**: emerging

## CRC MSS context

- **Anti-PD-1 monotherapy in MSS mCRC**: ORR <5% (well established)
- **Anti-PD-1 + chemo + anti-VEGF**: marginal benefit in some subgroups
- **CRC MSS R1 overlap**: many patients have already had anti-PD-1 (especially in China where camrelizumab/sintilimab are commonly added to chemo backbones in 2L+) — bispecific trials may exclude prior PD-1 exposure

## Risk pattern

- **CRS (cytokine release syndrome)** for T-cell engagers — graded G1–G4. G1–G2 manageable with tocilizumab + supportive care; G3+ requires ICU.
- **On-target/off-tumor toxicity** for CEA × CD3 — diarrhea, colitis (CEA expressed in normal gut)
- **irAE** spectrum from PD-1 axis: hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis
- **Ramp-up dosing required** — first cycles at low dose, escalation per protocol

## Patient-specific considerations

For our PT-17CE02BC33 example (KRAS G12C MSS mCRC, prior camrelizumab + apatinib):
- Bispecific anti-PD-1 × anti-VEGF would be redundant with prior treatment classes — unlikely to qualify as differentiated path
- Bispecific CEA × CD3 — novel mechanism, not previously exposed, but ORR data sparse in CRC
- If trial requires PD-1 naive, R1 will trigger from prior camrelizumab
