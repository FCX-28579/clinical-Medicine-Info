# Goals-of-Care Trigger Logic

## The bug being fixed

v1.7.x `synthesis/goals_of_care.py` triggered GoC by comparing `patient.treatment_lines_completed` to ontology thresholds. For a CRC patient on L3 ongoing therapy, `treatment_lines_completed = 2` (L3 not yet completed), so the lookup compared against `2_post_second_line` threshold (9 months for CRC) and decided "9 > 6 → no trigger". Result: 69yo IV CRC with severe CV comorbidity entering L4 got NO GoC discussion.

**v2 rule**: count the current ongoing line in trigger evaluation.

## Trigger conditions (any one fires)

### Trigger 1 — Line + cancer-type median OS

```
effective_line = patient.treatment_lines_completed
if patient.current_therapy_ongoing == true:
    effective_line += 1

cancer_ontology = clinical_ontology.cancers[patient.cancer_type]
median_os_at_line = cancer_ontology.median_os_months_at_line[f"{effective_line}_post_..."]
or fallback to cancer_ontology.median_os_months_at_line["3_plus"] if effective_line >= 3

threshold = cancer_ontology.goc_trigger_threshold_months  # default 6 months

if median_os_at_line <= threshold:
    trigger("Line + median OS")
```

For PT-17CE02BC33 (CRC, treatment_lines_completed=2, current_therapy_ongoing=true):
- effective_line = 3
- CRC `3_plus` median OS per ontology = 6 months
- threshold = 6
- 6 <= 6 → TRIGGER ✅ (previously v1.7.x compared 9 against 6 → no trigger ❌)

### Trigger 2 — Rapid progression

```
last_regimen = patient.treatment_history[-1] (or [-2] if -1 is ongoing with positive response)
if last_regimen.outcome == "PD" AND last_regimen.cycles <= 4:
    trigger("Rapid progression on most recent line")
```

### Trigger 3 — Performance status

```
if patient.ecog >= 2 OR patient.kps <= 60:
    trigger("ECOG/KPS suggests limited treatment tolerance")
```

### Trigger 4 — Cumulative comorbidity burden

```
serious_comorbidities = count of items in patient.comorbidities matching:
  - cardiac (CAD, post-stent, HF, severe valve disease)
  - renal (eGFR < 60 baseline, CKD stage 3+, dialysis)
  - hepatic (cirrhosis, severe transaminase derangement, ascites)
  - active CNS disease (uncontrolled mets, prior stroke with residual deficit)
  - active second malignancy

if serious_comorbidities >= 3 OR any single life-limiting comorbidity (e.g. ESRD on HD, NYHA Class IV):
    trigger("Cumulative comorbidity burden constrains regimen tolerability")
```

For PT-17CE02BC33: T2DM + HTN3 + CAD + post-stenting + recent renal dysfunction = 4 serious items → trigger ✅

### Trigger 5 — All-Phase-1 trial landscape

```
if all top decision paths are Phase 1 dose-escalation only:
    trigger("All best options are early-phase; counsel patient on uncertainty")
```

## Discussion recommendation framing

When triggered, emit a `discussion_recommendation` paragraph that:

1. States median OS at current line per cancer-type ontology (cite the source)
2. Frames the trial pathway as ONE option, not THE option
3. Lists alternatives explicitly: continued SoC (regorafenib/TAS-102/fruquintinib for CRC), best supportive care, hospice, comfort-focused care
4. Mentions trial logistics burden (cross-city travel, manufacture window for cell therapy, screening visits)
5. Avoids "推荐" / "should pursue" / "best option" language — uses "可选项" / "需讨论" / "权衡"

Example output for PT-17CE02BC33:

```
At L4 mCRC, median OS per published data is approximately 6 months (CRC ontology, sourced from CORRECT/RECOURSE/SUNLIGHT pivotal trials). Patient has substantial cardiovascular comorbidity (HTN3 + CAD + post-stenting) that may further constrain tolerance for cytotoxic regimens.

Trial enrollment is one option but not the only one. Recommend the family discuss with the treating oncologist:
- Approved L4 SoC options: sotorasib + panitumumab (FDA approved for KRAS G12C mCRC), regorafenib, TAS-102 + bevacizumab, fruquintinib
- Best supportive care + palliative care consultation (orthogonal to anti-cancer treatment, not an alternative)
- Trial-specific logistics: cross-city travel from 山西长治 to 北京, screening visit burden (typically 2-3 weeks), Phase 1/2 dosing uncertainty

Patient and family should hear realistic prognosis before committing to trial logistics. The decision is theirs.
```

## When NOT to trigger

Do NOT trigger GoC for:

- Patients on first line (regardless of comorbidities — first-line treatment options are usually robust)
- Patients with stable disease on current line and good performance status
- Patients with adjuvant intent (treatment is curative, not palliative)
